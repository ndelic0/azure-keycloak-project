## Overview

This project automates the process of deploying Keycloak on Azure using the following steps:

1. **Provisioning infrastructure with Terraform**:
   - A virtual network, subnet, and public IP are created on Azure.
   - An Azure virtual machine is provisioned with an SSH key for access.

2. **Setting up Keycloak with Ansible**:
   - Docker is installed on the VM.
   - Docker Compose is used to deploy Keycloak and a PostgreSQL database.
   - Keycloak is configured with default credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the infrastructure and application, youâ€™ll need to set up the following:

1. **Terraform** - Ensure you have Terraform installed. You can download it from [Terraform's website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. **Ansible** - Ansible is required to manage the configuration of the server. Install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install ansible
